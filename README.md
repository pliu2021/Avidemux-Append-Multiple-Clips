# Avidemux-Append-Multiple-Clips
* Allows you to append multiple clips at several clicks, without which you can only append them one by one.

* Extremly useful for cars' recorders

## Steps
1. Put your clips in one folder
2. Run the `generateproject.exe` and select that folder
3. You will get a text file in that folder, copy the text. (Make sure you have replaced all the `\` by `/`)
4. Paste the text in project file (ends with `.py`)
5. Run the project in Avidemux


## To Solve
Generate the project file directly, without replace and copy.

## To avoid
Avidemux loads all the clips in memory. So be careful don't exceed the limit.
